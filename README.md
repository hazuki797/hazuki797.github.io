<h2>Hazuki's Github Portfolio</h2>
This Portfolio webpage was created using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. It showcases my skills, achievements, and experiences as a web developer. The website was designed to be responsive and visually appealing, with a clean and modern interface that reflects my personality and style.

The homepage includes a navigation bar at the top of the website that allows easy access to different sections of the website, such as my Projects, LinkedIn, and Github. Each section provides more information about my work and skills as a developer.

The Projects section highlights some of my best work, including projects completed during my Fullstack programming coding bootcamp with MIT xPRO. Each project includes a brief description and a link to view the project live or the GitHub repository.

Thank you for taking the time to explore my portfolio! If you have any questions or would like to get in touch, please don't hesitate to contact me.

It will continue to evolve as I collect more projects to showcase.
